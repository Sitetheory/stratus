## Thesis

This is a minimalistic framework that becomes progressively more complex on-demand.  [Read More...](docs/Thesis.md)

## Goals

* Creative Design
* Code-Free Design
* Elegant Simplicity
* Abstract Extensibility
* Optimal Performance

## Frameworks & Libraries

##### Dependent

* Lodash

##### Recommended

* AMD, CJS, System.js, or equivalent loader

##### Optional

* Angular
* AngularJS
* React

## Usage

#### Deployment

Stratus is built to run within an AMD or equivalent environment with Async/Await or Promises.  For an independent implementation without an asset loader, further functionality involving auto-loading dependencies will not be present, so any javascript dependencies and templates will need to be defined directly on the DOM. 

#### Angular

Angular is in heavy development.  [Read More...](docs/Angular.md)

#### AngularJS

AngularJS is stable and takes additions with ease.  [Read More...](docs/AngularJS.md)

#### React

We don't have any data bindings or Auto-Loading built for React, yet.  [Read More...](docs/React.md)
